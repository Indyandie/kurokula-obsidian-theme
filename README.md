# Kurokula

> Referenced the [Dracula Official Theme](https://github.com/dracula/obsidian) as starting point. Thank you, [chrismettal](https://gitlab.com/chrismettal)! ðŸ™‡

Color theme branched from [**darcula**](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/runtime/themes/darcula.toml). It didn't merely adopt the darkness, it was born in it!
